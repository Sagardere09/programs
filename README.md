**P-1:** Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
       Example 1:
         
         Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
         
         Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
         return [0, 1].
 

**P-2:** Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
         
         Example 1:
         
         Input: "abcabcbb"
         Output: 3 
         Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
         

**P-3:** You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
       Example 1:
         
         Example 1:
         
         nums1 = [1, 3]
         nums2 = [2]
         
         The median is 2.0
         Example 2:
         
         nums1 = [1, 2]
         nums2 = [3, 4]
         
         The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

**P-4:** Pyramid pattern using string character


       
         Example 1:
         
         Input: s = "abcdefghij", numRows = 4
         Output:       a 
                      b c 
                     d e f 
                    g h i j
        

**P-5:** Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
        Example 1:
         
         Input: 123
         Output: 321 
       

**P-6:** find largest and second largest number in an array.
        Example 1:
         
         Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
         Output: 8 , 7
   
        
**P-7:** Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

            Symbol       Value
            I             1
            V             5
            X             10
            L             50
            
  
      Input: 3
      Output: "III"
      Input: 9
      Output: "IX"
   


**P-8:** Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

         Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

       
         Example 1:
         
         Given nums = [1,1,2],
         
         Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

       
**P-9:** Given a string contains some words reverse that string 
     
       
         Example 1: 
         
         Given string = "I am Sagar Dere";
         
         Output = Dere Sagar am I
        


**P-10:** Given a number convert into real words 
     
       
         Example 1: 
         
         Given number = 189456
         
         Output = One Lakhs Eighty Nine Thousand Four Hundred Fifty Six
        

**P-11:** You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

    Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
    
    Note:
    
    You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
    
    Example 1:
    
    Given input matrix = 
    [
      [1,2,3],
      [4,5,6],
      [7,8,9]
    ],
    
    rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
    [
      [7,4,1],
      [8,5,2],
      [9,6,3]
    ]

**P-12:** Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

    A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.
    
    
   
    Example:
    
    Input: 23
    Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].




**P-13:** Find Out string is palindrome or not. 
    
     Example:
     
     Input: madam
     Output: String is palindrome.
     Input: sagar
     Output: String is not palindrome.
